Internet Protocol Suite 

I.P is the first layer (Internet Protocol)
everything to the Net has an address and it looks something like 192.1.005 
google.com routes to a DNS and fetches the ip address then the sever tied to it is called then the sever 

Transport Layer
Transport Protocol (TCP) transmission control protocol
TCP gruantees that the packets are sent and received in the same order it was initailzed 

to see a website in TCP you need the four step process of handshakes but its much slower

UDP USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL

UDP uses no handshakes in order to connect but there no guarantees of packets but its must faster common use is VOIP


Application Layer
HTTP "is how you have a conversation"
Using HTTP verbs we can request (GET) information from the sever then you receive a response 200 = OK
404 = client gave a malformed request
500 = server error  

proxy = is a way to wall to your IP in front of another IP address
