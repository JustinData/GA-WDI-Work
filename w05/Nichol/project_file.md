##Day 2, Log
---

What I Did Yesterday -

* Got user model and proclamations model working, related, and populating data.
* Some elements of basic interface.
* Authentication but NOT Authorization
* Javascript HTML5 Geolocation script & how to access divs in Javascript
* entered user stories into pivotal tracker and played with that and started getting some velocity!
* reviewed user stories and schema from project_plan.md (included in my pull request)


What I'm Doing Today -

* deploy to heroku
* add new model votes
* work on better user interface / navigation
* work on authorization
* need to think more about what users can do / how to show info...

Obstacles & Potential Hangups - 

* it took me two hours to deploy to heroku because my git was incorrectly configured for heroku which was really annoying!
* i need to delve deeper into user routes and methods to get the authorization working, requires understanding all ins and outs of deviseâ€¦
* i have no idea what to do with this javascript thing.
