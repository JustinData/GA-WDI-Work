>## User Stories in order of implementation:

* As a user, I want to sign in so I can have my selected senator(s) saved.

* As a user, I want to input my zipcode and see what US senator represents me because I may not know.

* As a user, I want to click on my senator and see what Disney character they are most like because I read too much Buzzfeed. 

* As a user, I want to see some legislative actions that my senator made so I can understand why they are like that Disney character. 

* As a user, I want to see some links to my senator's social media so I can contact them.

* As a user, I want to search again so I can learn about other representatives. 


>## Scrummin' It:

* So far I have completed: As a user, I want to input my zipcode and see what US senator represents me because I may not know. I also implemented: As a user, I want to see some links to my senator's social media so I can contact them.

* Today I need to understand my sunlight congress API (not gem) enough to extract votes on four different pieces of legislation. I then need to add these (as a four digit "key")into a votes column in my senator schema. I then need plan how to match the data that I have stored into the votes column with a disney character table.
