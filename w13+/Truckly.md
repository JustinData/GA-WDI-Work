#Truck.ly

This is an app you can work on to continue to practice your skills with Modeling, BDD, Rails, and JavaScript.

We're going to build an app to help us manage and keep track of Food Trucks. Food trucks can move around and change locations to sell their food. Typically, a food truck has a name, theme/cuisine, as well as a menu of food items, each of which has its own name and price.

As a user, I'd love to be able to go to the app and browse all the of Food Trucks on there. I also would want to be able to see which food trucks are currently open, where they are, and what they are selling. A map might be a handy way to do this.

As a food truck owner, I'd love to be able to sign up and add my truck to the list of trucks on the app. I also want to be able to manage my truck in terms of where it is currently located and what menu items I'm selling.

It's up to you what technology you want to use to solve this problem, but make sure to take the opportunity to practice our BDD workflow. Spend some time modeling out the problem and writing really clear, specific and incremental user stories.
