# Post-class Workflow

As we wrap up our time together in the classroom, your learning workflow will be a lot more self-directed. To help focus your time, especially over the next couple of weeks, we've put together this guide on how to approach it and stay effective.

## Scrum
* Do a personal scrum every day and write it down in a log. What Tom did over the Thanksgiving holiday is a great example of this. Bonus points if you share your log of what you're doing with others from the class.
* Spent 15 minutes to:
  * Review what you accomplished the day before
  * Plan what you are going to tackle that day, however big or small.
  * Identify anything that might be blocking you and figure out what needs to happen to remove those blockers
* Make it a goal to open your terminal every day. We've learned an incredible about over the past 3 months, and most likely all of it hasn't quite cemented in your brain yet. It's critical that you keep practicing because you will start to forget quickly if you don't. I know things get busy around the holidays with family, but even a little bit every day will help you keep forward progress and momentum.

## Self-assessment
* I've included an up to date version of everything we've learned in a file called `Self_Assessment.md` in this folder
* Review your self-assessment on a regular basis and chip away at all the stuff you are unsure about little by little
* Pay particular attention to the topics of Testing and Object Oriented Design

## Personal Portfolio Site
* I've included the prompt and example portfolio sites in this folder. You'll want to get this looking good before you start applying for jobs.

## Github Profile
* Make sure that the repos you have in your public Github profile are documented with descriptions / READMEs
* Try to make sure that you have at least one well-tested project displayed prominently (This will probably be your final project)

## Keep Building
* Continue writing code and building apps. I'm sure all of you will want to continue working on your final project to either add new features, refactor, or improve testing.
* I've included a prompt for a Food Truck themed Rails app if you are interested in building a new project from scratch. It's called `Truckly.md` :)

## Reading
* [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321721330/ref=sr_1_1) - If there is one book you read over the next month, this should be it.
* Otherwise refer to the relevant books as needed to help you go through the self-assessment. Foundational Ruby and JavaScript books are also always good.

## Interview Prep & Practice Problem
* [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems)
* [Rubeque](http://www.rubeque.com/problems)
* [JavaScript Under Pressure](http://games.usvsth3m.com/javascript-under-pressure/)
* [Code Quizzes](http://www.codequizzes.com/)
* [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/)
* Google Search for `Ruby Interview Questions`, `JavaScript Interview Questions`, etc
