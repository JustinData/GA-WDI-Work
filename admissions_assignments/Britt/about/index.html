	<div id='acting'><p id='actor'>Britt is an actor.<br><br><br>After playing Joe Cable in South Pacific when he was in sixth grade, Britt was bit by the acting bug. He acted in many plays and musicals through high school, and he attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Camp in upstate New York, where he grew to truly love the craft. He studied musical theater at Catholic University in his hometown of Washington, D.C., where he received his Bachelor's degree of Music. During his years at Catholic, he also studied for a semester in London, where he honed his skills and further developed an appreciation for Sheakpearean theater. He now lives in New York City.<br><br>For more information about his experience, you can find his resume on <a href='http://www.backstage.com/brittlewis/'>Backstage</a>.<br><br><br><a href='#top'>^</a></p></div>
	<div id='music'><p id='musician'>Britt is a musician.<br><br><br>While he loves acting, music was Britt's first artistic passion; more specifically, singing. He began singing about as soon as he could phonate, with earliest memories being preschool carols and harmonizing with his mother (ears firmly plugged) to simple <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Jack_Horner'>rounds</a>. Beginning in grade school and through college, Britt also sang in various choirs, which developed his strong musical ear as well as his appreciation for diverse styles of music. Through musicals in high school Britt was able to marry his love for music with his excitement to act. He also plays guitar, which he began teaching himself in 2003 (though he would like to add that that makes him sound a far more capable and accomplished guitarist than he is). His favorite guitar, and currenty his only guitar, is a Taylor Grand Auditorium 3 with custom electrics. Generally, acoustic is his preffered style, with a particular fondness for Taylor & Martin guitars.<br><br><br><a href='#top'>^</a></p></div>
	<div id='programming'><p id='programmer'>And soon... <br><br><strong>Britt will be a programmer.</strong><br><br><br>After loving and working with technology for most of his life, Britt is now pursuing his latest creative endeavor: web development. To that end, Britt has applied to immersive, bootcamp-type courses geared toward a swift and thorough dunking into the world of html, css, and rails, culminating in a sort of debutante with the NYC startup scene. With the goal of being an employed developer by the end of the year, he has set his sights on <a href='http://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/new-york-city'>General Assembly</a>, <a href='http://www.appacademy.io/#p-home'>App Academy</a>, and <a href='http://flatironschool.com/'>The Flatiron School</a>. Through his tenacity, drive, strong work ethic, and most importantly, his excitement, Britt is sure to succeed in empowering himself, and to create and build things that are truly and uniquely his own.<br><br>If you'd like to follow Britt in his journey, be sure to check out his <a href='http://tumblr.britt.is'>tumblr</a>.<br><br><br><a href='#top'>^</a></p></div>
