  I am a New York City Native-born and raised from Hispanic decent. My First interest in "Web Dev" started about 3 years ago. Ever since I was young I always had a entrepreneurial spirit. My long career Started when I was a teenager selling and trading anything I could get my hands on. After high school I took my sales talents to the Finance Industry. After about a 4 year grind of sleepless years and feeling like Im always chasing something usually money, but never really sure why your chasing it in the first place. </p>

  <p>So I left with great timing (few months before the crash!) I just picked up a f bar gig at a really exclusive members only club to keep myself busy and meet network with NY elite. While bartending I had spoken with lots of people of the same Industry and was curious as to what were there day-to-day challenges with technical solutions. I saw a possible opportunity and went off to create my own start-up. 2 yrs. and 50K of my own investment later and waala I had efficiently found away to create a non-profit for offshore developers. I had no MVP just some great back of the napkin stuff. This was one of my biggest eye openers into just how important it is to have some technical background if your going to be a technical company (DUH!). So after another year of hitting the books literally Ive come to the enlightenment that I need a mentor in this flied as it changes to rapid and the big picture becomes really faint to grasp. I decided to seek training, but not for a start-up of my own, but more to work for one for at least a few years and really get an opportunity to see how everything works. The industry is very consuming once youre in it. I think I really enjoy because of the fact I really feel like am contributing something on a tangible level. Whereas in Finance its more of a disassociated feeling and I think that is what left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I really think that GA would be a life changing opportunity for me. I truly believe I would excel if given the chance and look forward to meeting you soon.
