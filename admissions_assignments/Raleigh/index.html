		<h2>The College Years</h2>
		<div class="left blue med">
			<h3>The BFA In GD</h3>
			<p>I studied graphic design in college in an effort to combine my love of computers and my artistic talents. At first I thought I might have found a good career path since I enjoyed the medium and many other aspects of design. However, I found the overall process lacking the structure that I desired. I quickly realized that graphic design would not work long term since the subject matter was not enough to keep me engaged.</p>
			</div>
			
		<div class="right mint small movedwn">
			<h3>Code Lovin'</h3>
			<p>During my senior year I took a couple programming courses and found that I enjoyed the material. Learning the code was difficult but I liked having a set number of elements that I could use to construct a larger application. Thus, the innovation was in how one utilized the elements, not in the creation of them.</p>

		<h2>Post Graduation</h2>
		<div class="left mint small movedwn">
			<h3>This Could Work</h3>				
			<p>A year after graduation I finally started to identify what I wanted to do in terms of a career. Much of the coding process at the beginning had been "trial and error." However, the problems or challenges I encountered while learning only increased my interest in the subject.</p>
		</div>	
		
		<div class="right blue med">
			<h3>You Can Always Go Home</h3>
			<p>After college, I returned home to help my family and plan my next career steps. The following year I homeschooled my younger sister, completed some freelance projects, and worked as the front-end developer for a non-profit, Beyond Our Borders (BOB). Working for BOB was a great experience. I was able to implement my HTML and CSS skills as well as delve into web development on a professional level. I continued to teach myself through books and online tutorials. The more I studied, the more I wanted to learn.</p>

		<h2>Where I Am Now</h2>
		<div class="left blue med">
			<h3>Hooked on Code</h3>
			<p>I realized in order to follow my passion for web development, I needed more training so I began to look for programs in the area. Fortunately, a nearby school had a Webmaster Certification Program (WCP) in Web Development. Unfortunately, that track was not in session at the time. However, the Web Design Track was available. I decided to take the Design Track, which focused on XHTML and CSS with some JavaScript. I was surprised to discover how much information I had overlooked by teaching myself. Needless to say I was officially hooked.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="right mint small movedwn">
			<h3>Ready To Work</h3>
			<p>The WCP program finishes this week, and I can say without a doubt that I would like to be a web developer. I want to learn as much as possible in the next few months so I can start my career in web development and be confident in my coding skills.</p>
