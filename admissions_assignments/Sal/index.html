			<h2> About Me </h2> 
			<div id="content">
				<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>

				<p> <img src="images/sal-pic.jpg" alt="Sal Picture"> My name is Salvatore (Sal for short) Lardizzone. I am 27 years of age, and currently live in Carmel, NY. For work, I have been employed at an executive search firm called <a href="http://www.leitnersarch.com" target="_blank">Leitner Sarch Consultants</a> for almost four years now.  Shortly after graduating from Fordham University in 2008 with a degree in Communications, I essentially fell into the field during my extensive job search.  Located in White Plains, NY, LSC is a boutique recruiting firm that specializes in placing wealth management professionals. As Research Director at LSC, I provide our recruiters with leads, useful data, and candidate lists based on search criteria that is requested by our clients. </p>

				<p><strong>Bored yet? ME TOO!</strong></p>

				<p> As the monotony of the job started to become overwhelmng, I began to pick up several tutorials, I subscribed to <a href="http://www.lynda.com" target="_blank">lynda.com</a>, and attempted several of the tracks on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a> in order to see if I would enjoy web development/programming (which I did). I even took a C++ course at Brooklyn College after work while I was living in Greenpoint with intentions of possibly beginning a Computer Science track. But when I heard about General Assembly through a friend, I immediately jumped on the idea and relocated back home to Carmel in order to save up for some long form courses (and hopefully the WDI). I am currently 3/4 done with the Front End Web Development course and I absolutely love it. My brain is being put to the test again, and it feels great. After this course I hope to continue learning the real meat of the web that is back end development.  </p>

				<p>Outside of work I enjoy playing music, specifically bass, and have been in several bands such as Brooklyn bred <a href="https://www.facebook.com/suchhounds" target="_blank">Such Hounds</a>, and Boston based <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CurseThisEarth" target="_blank">VYGR</a>.  I also watch an immense amount of movies, as I am constantly on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> taking note of all the newest and acclaimed releases. </p> 

				<p>I am looking forward to the in person interview!</p>
